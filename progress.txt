# Progress Notes - In DO Time

## Iteration 1 - Scaffold Next.js project with TailwindCSS and App Router
- What was implemented:
  - Scaffolded Next.js 16.1.6 with App Router and TypeScript
  - TailwindCSS 4.x configured with PostCSS
  - ESLint configured for Next.js
  - Source files in `src/` directory with `@/*` import alias
  - Moved DO Code Lab logo to `public/DO_CODE_LAB_LOGO_NO_TEXT.png`
- Files changed:
  - Created standard Next.js project structure
  - package.json (name: "in-do-time")
  - src/app/layout.tsx, page.tsx, globals.css
  - tsconfig.json, next.config.ts, tailwind.config.ts
  - postcss.config.mjs, eslint.config.mjs
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Next.js 16 uses TailwindCSS v4 with new PostCSS plugin (@tailwindcss/postcss)
  - React 19 is bundled with Next.js 16
  - create-next-app doesn't allow spaces or caps in project names - must use subdirectory approach
  - Logo placed at public/DO_CODE_LAB_LOGO_NO_TEXT.png as specified in PRD

## Iteration 2 - Set up Supabase client and environment variables
- What was implemented:
  - Created .env.example with Supabase URL and anon key template
  - Created .env.local for local development (gitignored)
  - Created src/lib/supabase.ts with typed Supabase client
  - Created src/types/database.ts with full TypeScript types matching PRD schema
  - Updated .gitignore to track .env.example but ignore .env.local
- Files changed:
  - .env.example (new)
  - .env.local (new, gitignored)
  - src/lib/supabase.ts (new)
  - src/types/database.ts (new)
  - .gitignore (updated)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - @supabase/supabase-js was already installed in package.json
  - Database types include Row, Insert, Update variants for each table
  - Convenience types (Client, Project, TimeEntry) exported for easier use
  - Next.js build confirms .env.local is loaded (shows "Environments: .env.local")
---

## Iteration 3 - Run database schema migration (create all 3 tables + indexes)
- What was implemented:
  - Created supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql with full schema
  - All 3 tables: clients, projects, time_entries
  - All 3 indexes: idx_time_entries_project, idx_time_entries_start, idx_projects_client
  - Added updated_at triggers for automatic timestamp updates
  - Enabled RLS with permissive policies (single-user MVP, no auth)
  - Created supabase/README.md with setup instructions
- Files changed:
  - supabase/migrations/001_initial_schema.sql (new)
  - supabase/README.md (new)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Migration file uses IF NOT EXISTS for idempotent runs
  - RLS must be enabled with permissive policies for anon access
  - Migration is meant to be run in Supabase SQL Editor (not automated CLI)
  - Build and lint pass - project remains in healthy state
---

## Iteration 4 - Place DO Code Lab logo in public/ and generate favicon
- What was implemented:
  - Logo already existed at public/DO_CODE_LAB_LOGO_NO_TEXT.png (from iteration 1)
  - Generated 32x32 icon.png from logo using macOS sips
  - Generated 180x180 apple-icon.png for Apple touch devices
  - Removed default favicon.ico
  - Updated layout.tsx metadata title to "In DO Time"
  - Updated layout.tsx metadata description to "Multi-client time tracking for DO Code Lab"
- Files changed:
  - src/app/icon.png (new - generated from logo)
  - src/app/apple-icon.png (new - generated from logo)
  - src/app/favicon.ico (deleted)
  - src/app/layout.tsx (updated metadata)
  - PRD.md (marked task complete)
- Learnings for future iterations:
  - Next.js App Router auto-detects icon.png and apple-icon.png in app/ directory
  - macOS sips is available for image conversion when ImageMagick isn't installed
  - Build output shows /icon.png and /apple-icon.png as static routes when properly placed
  - Favicon should be in app/ dir not public/ for App Router convention
